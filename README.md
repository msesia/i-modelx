## Paper abstract

Model-X knockoffs and the conditional randomization test are methods that search for conditional
associations in large data sets, controlling the type-I errors if the joint distribution of the predictors is
known. However, they cannot test for interactions nor find whether an association is only significant
within a latent subset of a heterogeneous population. We address this limitation by developing an
extension of the knockoff filter that tests conditional associations within automatically detected subsets
of individuals, provably controlling the false discovery rate for the selected hypotheses. Then, under
the additional assumption of a partially linear model with a binary predictor, we extend the conditional
randomization test as to make inferences about quantiles of individual effects that are robust to sample
heterogeneity and interactions. The performances of these methods are investigated through simulations
and with the analysis of data from a randomized blood donation experiment with several treatments.
