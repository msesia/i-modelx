*This folder contains the code for the simulations and the real data analysis based on the UK Biobank data. The folder does not contain any data files. We have applied for the UK Biobank data (application number 27837) and interested parties can apply to the UK Biobank for data access. The analysis was conducted in R/4.2.0.* 


- To reproduce the results from the real data analysis (section 3.3) please refer to file **process_description.md** for a detailed description of the required steps. 

- To reproduce the results from the genetic simulations (section 3.2 and appendix A6), please refer to file **simulation_files_description.md** for a description of the required steps.

In addition to the files described above, which explain the process of reproducing the results, this folder contains:

- The folder **utils** holds all utility scripts. The individual files are described in **process_description.md** and **simulation_files_description.md**. 

- The folder **batch_scripts** contains .sh scripts for running the real data analysis as well as functions for the simulation. These scripts are also described in **process_description.md** and **simulation_files_description.md**.
